    When carrying out data analyses it is desirable to do so in a reproducible way.
    This aim is easier to achieve if a close link between the code, its documentation
    and the results is maintained. If done consistently this leads to reports that
    are relatively easy to maintain and can be updated automatically if either the data 
    or details of the analysis change.
    
    Here we are exploring the use of R package `knitr` and the document conversion tool
    `pandoc` to generate reproducible reports in R. After a general introduction to these
    two tools aspects relevant to the writing of scientific reports are discussed in
    some detail.
