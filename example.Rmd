# Introduction
This is an example document demonstrating how to use 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown Markdown] documents with embedded R code to
create dynamic documents in multiple formats, e.g. HTML, PDF and Word. This is useful
to generate reports (or papers) that contain all the relevant R code to carry out
the analysis and allows for automatic updates to the document if either the code or 
the data change. As a result analyses become a lot easier to reproduce because the code  
and the presentation of results are closely linked and figures and tables can be updated 
automatically.

Several tools are available to do this but here we will mainly focus on a combination
of two of these.

  ~ This R package provides functions that allow the processing of Markdown documents
    with embedded R code. The code will be executed and its output, including plots,
    can be included in the output.
[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/ pandoc]
  ~ This is a versatile tool that supports conversion between a large number of input
    and output formats. We will use pandoc's own Markdown flavour (which includes
    numerous extension to the original format) as input and use its conversion capabilities
    to obtain output in several commonly used formats.
